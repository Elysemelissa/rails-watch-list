# Watchlist
The Watchlist was a project from Le Wagon to practice CRUD, front-end and Heroku deployment with Rails. 

<h3>Functionality</h3>
The web-app allows you to create lists, upload a background image for the list card, and add movies (from a seed) to the list. <br>
The app uses the TMDB API for the movie posters.
